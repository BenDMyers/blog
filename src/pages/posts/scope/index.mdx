## Introduction

Consider the following JavaScript and Bash snippets:

<SideBySide>
    <IntroductionJavascriptSnippet />
    <IntroductionBashSnippet />
</SideBySide>

Ask yourself: **what value will the JavaScript code log? Why will it log that?** Let's turn to the Bash snippet. With the exception of some slight syntax differences, it looks pretty similar to the JavaScript code. **What will the Bash script log? Is it different from the JavaScript code? Why or why not?**

Feel free to run both snippets for yourself. When we run the JavaScript snippet, it logs `"Ben"`. The Bash code, however, echoes `"Myers"` instead.

Why are these two results different? To understand that, we'll need to understand scope.

## What Is Scope?

<p><dfn>Scope</dfn> refers to which variables and functions are accessible at a given point during a program's execution.</p>

Languages can define different kinds of scopes. These scopes could include

Scopes can nest like [matryoshka dolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll). We can have an `if` block inside of a `for` loop inside of a function inside the global scope, as in this JavaScript implementation of [FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz):

<div id="nestedScopesExample">
	<FizzbuzzSnippet />
</div>
