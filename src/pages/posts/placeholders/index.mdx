## Introduction

Since its introduction in HTML5, the `placeholder` attribute has become commonplace in web forms.

<!-- > ```html -->
<!-- <input placeholder="First name" /> -->
<!-- ``` -->

Placeholders are commonly used to provide example values or expected formats:

<div className="placeholders--container">
    <form aria-label="Dummy form that uses placeholders to illustrate sample values">
        <label for="placeholder-ex-1--name">Name</label>
        <input id="placeholder-ex-1--name" className="post-placeholder-input" placeholder="John Doe" />
        <label for="placeholder-ex-1--cellphone">Cell Phone</label>
        <input id="placeholder-ex-1--cellphone" className="post-placeholder-input" placeholder="(555) 555-5555" type="tel" />
    </form>
</div>

Some websites decide to forgo form labels in favor of placeholders, in the name of minimalism.

<div className="placeholders--container">
    <form aria-label="Dummy shipping address form that uses placeholders in place of labels">
        <div className="placeholders--header">Enter a shipping address</div>
        <input className="post-placeholder-input" placeholder="Name" />
        <input className="post-placeholder-input" placeholder="Address line 1" />
        <input className="post-placeholder-input" placeholder="Address line 2" />
        <div className="placeholders--grid placeholders--grid--col-3">
            <input className="post-placeholder-input" placeholder="City" />
            <input className="post-placeholder-input" placeholder="State" />
            <input className="post-placeholder-input" placeholder="ZIP" />
        </div>
    </form>
</div>

However, for many users, especially those with disabilities, placeholders are rather... _ghostlike_.

* They're tricky to see, perhaps translucent.
* They may not announce their presence.
* They're prone to disappearing the moment you try to interact with them.

Left unchecked, these things can pose significant usability problems for your users.

## Color Contrast

Browsers default to giving placeholders a muted appearance, whether by making them a light gray or by reducing their opacity. For example, the default placeholder in Google Chrome is black with 54% opacity.<Fn fn="chromeopacity" /> This muted appearance signals to users that this text here isn't a _real_ value.â€”
