## Introduction

I admit it. I'm a sucker for creating little shortcuts and scripts to speed up work in my terminal. There's just something oddly thrilling about typing a few characters and kicking off several commands. I recently read Chiamaka Ikeanyi's [Avoiding Shell Hell: Aliases to the Rescue](https://chiamakaikeanyi.dev/avoiding-shell-hell-aliases-to-the-rescue/), and I was inspired to share some alias tricks I use on a daily basis.

My team at work manages six projects. Each project has its own repository. Additionally, we have repositories for developer tools made by the team. Combine that with any other directories we use on a daily basis, and `cd` quickly becomes our most frequent command.

My favorite terminal trick, for both my home and work computers, is creating short, memorable aliases to `cd` to my most frequent directories. If I want to write a new post, I just type `blog` and I'm in my Gatsby codebase. If I need to tweak the response from a mock server, I type `mock`, and I can start poking around my Express.js code. I rarely have to worry about long, complex relative paths.

## üêß The Unix Way

Pick a directory you use often, and a memorable alias you'll use to hop to that directory instantly. In my case, I want to go to my `~/blog` directory whenever I use my `blog` alias.

Let's give it a shot! In your terminal, run the following commands:

```shell
~$ alias blog="cd ~/blog"
~$ cd some/other/directory/
~/some/other/directory$  blog
~/blog$
```

No matter which working directory we're in, issuing the `blog` command now takes us directly to `~/blog`. Mission accomplished! We can close our terminal and call it a day.

Next time, we can just open up our terminal and...

```console
~$ blog
-bash: blog: command not found
~$
```

... oh.

Aliases only last as long as the terminal session. Since manually reestablishing our aliases every time we open the terminal would be a bit of a hassle,

```bash {numberLines: true}:title=.bashrc
# Add a new alias
# USAGE: a <new alias> <command>
function a() {
    if [[ "$#" -ne 2 ]]
    then
        echo "USAGE: a <alias> <expression>"
        return 0
    elif [[ -n "$(alias $1 2>/dev/null)" ]]
    then
        echo "Alias already exists!"
        return 0
    fi

    echo -e "alias $1=\"$2\"
$(cat ~/.bashrc)" > ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    echo "Alias was added successfully!"
}

# Creates an alias to jump to current directory
# USAGE: ad <new alias>
function ad() {
    dir=$(pwd)
    a "$1" "cd $dir"
}
```

## ü¶á The Windows Way
