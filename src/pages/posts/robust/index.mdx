## Introduction

The north star for web accessibility is [<dfn>POUR</dfn>](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/)â€”web content should be perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. <dfn>Robustness</dfn> ensures that your content isn't just perceivable, operable, and understandable, but that it's all of those things regardless of the browsers, devices, and assistive technologies that users use to access your page.

1. [Keep it simple](#keep-it-simple)
2. [Use semantic elements when applicable](#use-semantic-elements-when-applicable)
3. [Use less ARIA](#use-less-aria)
4. [Test often and test well](#test-often-and-test-well)

## ðŸŽ¡ Keep It Simple

You don't.

Complex, overengineered solutions contain many moving parts. Each moving part is a potential point of failure.

## ðŸ¦† Use Semantic Elements When Applicable

In my experience, UX is largely about setting up promises to your users and then following through on them. In [my post about using clickable divs as buttons](https://blog.benmyers.dev/clickable-divs/)

## ðŸ§‚ Use Less ARIA

## ðŸ§ª Test Often and Test Well
