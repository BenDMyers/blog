## Introduction

I admit it. I'm a sucker for creating little shortcuts and scripts to speed up work in my terminal. There's just something oddly thrilling about typing a few characters and kicking off several commands. I recently read Chiamaka Ikeanyi's [Avoiding Shell Hell: Aliases to the Rescue](https://chiamakaikeanyi.dev/avoiding-shell-hell-aliases-to-the-rescue/), and I was inspired to share some alias tricks I use on a daily basis.

My team at work manages six projects. Each project has its own repository. Additionally, we have repositories for developer tools made by the team. Combine that with any other directories we use on a daily basis, and `cd` quickly becomes our most frequent command.

My favorite terminal trick, for both my home and work computers, is creating short, memorable aliases to `cd` to my most frequent directories. If I want to write a new post, I just type `blog` and I'm in my Gatsby codebase. If I need to tweak the response from a mock server, I type `mock`, and I can start poking around my Express.js code. I rarely have to worry about long, complex relative paths. The terminal feels snappier, more intuitive, and—best of all—more *fun*.

If this is as appealing to you as it is to me, read on to find out how to alias your directories [the Unix way](#the-unix-way) or [the Windows way](#the-windows-way).

***

## The Unix Way

Pick a directory you use often, and a memorable alias you'll use to hop to that directory instantly. In my case, I want to go to my `~/blog` directory whenever I use my `blog` alias.

Let's give it a shot! In your terminal, run the following commands:

```shell
~$ alias blog="cd ~/blog"
~$ cd some/other/directory/
~/some/other/directory$ blog
~/blog$
```

No matter which working directory we're in, issuing the `blog` command now takes us directly to `~/blog`. Mission accomplished! We can close our terminal and call it a day.

Next time, we can just open up our terminal and...

```console
~$ blog
-bash: blog: command not found
~$
```

... oh.

Aliases only last as long as the terminal session. Since manually reestablishing our aliases every time we open the terminal would be a bit of a hassle, let's find a way to make our aliases persist.

### Persisting Bash Aliases

When you start a new interactive shell, your terminal runs a file called `.bashrc`, found in your root directory. Open `~/.bashrc` in your editor of choice. I'm using VS Code, but you could also use vi, emacs, nano, Atom, or whatever other editor floats your boat:

```shell
~$ code  ~/.bashrc
~$
```

(If `.bashrc` doesn't exist, go ahead and create it!)

We can drop our new alias in and save:

```bash {numberLines: true}:title=.bashrc
alias blog="cd ~/blog"
```

Back in our terminal, we tell our terminal to rerun `.bashrc` and receive our new aliases:

```shell
~$ source ~/.bashrc
~$ blog
~/blog$
```

In future terminal sessions, you won't even have to run `source`, since the terminal takes care of that for you. You'll be able to just run `blog` to your heart's content.

### But Wait! I Have a Mac!

The default macOS Terminal inexplicably treats *every* terminal session as a login session. This means that instead of running `~/.bashrc` on every session, the macOS Terminal runs `~/.bash_profile`. Cue facepalm.

You *can* account for this by just stuffing your aliases in `.bash_profile`. However, if you think you might want to use a different terminal at some point, the more resilient approach would be to have your `.bash_profile` source `.bashrc` on every login:

```bash {numberLines: true}:title=.bash_profile
if [ -r ~/.bashrc ]; then
    source ~/.bashrc
fi
```

For more information, [read this handy <i>Scripting OS X</i> guide to `.bash_profile` and `.bashrc`](https://scriptingosx.com/2017/04/about-bash_profile-and-bashrc-on-macos/).

### Adding Bash Aliases on the Fly

We can use Bash scripting to be even cuter about aliasing our directories. We'll create a quick command in our `.bashrc` file, called `ad`, that creates a persistent alias for the current directory.

```bash {numberLines: true}{12-13}:title=.bashrc
function ad() {
    if [[ "$#" -ne 1 ]]
    then
        echo "USAGE: ad <alias>"
        return 0
    elif [[ -n "$(alias $1 2>/dev/null)" ]]
    then
        echo "Alias already exists!"
        return 0
    fi

    echo -e "alias $1=\"cd $(pwd)\"" >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    echo "Alias was added successfully."
}

alias blog="cd ~/blog"
```

The interesting lines are 12 and 13 — the rest is just sanity checks.

Let's give our new `ad` command a whirl! If you're using an old terminal session, update your terminal's aliases with `source ~/.bashrc`. Then try using `ad`:

```shell
~$ cd ./codebase/Advent_Of_Code_2019
~/codebase/Advent_Of_Code_2019$ ad  advent
Alias was added successfully.
~/codebase/Advent_Of_Code_2019$ cd ~
~$ advent
~/codebase/Advent_Of_Code_2019$
```

`ad` has so thoroughly integrated itself into my day-to-day development work that I don't often create a new directory without instantly creating an alias for it.

***

## The Windows Way

Just as with the Unix steps, you'll want to pick a frequently used directory and a memorable command you'll use to hop to that directory. In my case, I want to run `blog` to hop to `C:\Ben\blog`.

In Windows, you can create aliases to use in Command Prompt with the `doskey` command. Open up Command Prompt and run the following:

```console
C:\> doskey  blog=cd  C:\Ben\blog
C:\> blog
C:\Ben\blog>
```

It works like a charm! However, if you close and reopen Command Prompt, you'll run into a bit of a problem:

```console
C:\> blog
'blog' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

Just as with the Unix `alias` command, `doskey` aliases don't persist. Instead, we have to put them in a persistent batch file.

### Persisting Doskey Aliases

Whereas Unix has `.bashrc` that runs with every new terminal session, Windows has no such files. We'll need to create our own.

Create a `.bat` file. You can call it whatever—`aliases.bat`, `scripts.bat`, `doskey.bat`…—so long as it works for you. I'll call mine `aliases.bat` and place it in the home directory.

Inside this batch file, I'll put:

```batch {numberLines: true}:title=aliases.bat
@echo off
doskey blog=cd C:\Ben\blog\
```

(That `@echo off` is to make sure the terminal doesn't vomit out the whole `aliases.bat` file whenever you start a new session)

The next step is making sure Command Prompt knows to run your batch file whenever you start a new terminal session.

1. **Open the Registry Editor.** Open up the Start menu, and search for _regedit_. Click the _Registry Editor_ result.

2. **Navigate to the Command Processor settings.**  This can be found at *HKEY_CURRENT_USER* → *Software* → *Microsoft* → *Command Processor*.

3. **Add an *AutoRun* value.** Right-click inside *Command Processor* and choose *New* → *String Value*. Give the new property the name `AutoRun`. Make the value the absolute path to your batch file of aliases.

Open a new session of Command Prompt, and try out your new aliases!

```console
C:\> blog
C:\Ben\blog>
```

You're good to go!

### Adding Doskey Aliases on the Fly

I like having an alias for just about any directory or workspace I might come back to. Manually modifying `aliases.bat` and restarting my terminal every time I create a directory would interrupt my flow, however. Instead, I have a batch script that automatically creates a persistent `doskey` alias to the current working directory whenever I use the `ad` command.

1. **Create a folder to store your scripts in.** I called my folder `C:\Ben\Batch`, but you can call it `Scripts` or `Commands` or any other meaningful name.

2. **Add your scripts folder to your PATH.** If you haven't done this before, check out [Ryan Hoffman's quick guide](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/).

3. **Create an `ad.bat` inside your scripts folder.** By calling this file `ad.bat`, you ensure that the file is executed whenever you run the command `ad`. Paste the following into `ad.bat`.

```batch {numberLines: true}{23-24}:title=ad.bat
@echo off
SETLOCAL

REM Verify exactly one argument was passed
if "%~1"=="" goto usage
if not "%~2"=="" goto usage

REM Verify alias doesn't already exist
for /f "tokens=*" %%a in ('doskey /macros:all ^| findstr %1=') do set foundAlias=%%a
if not "%foundAlias%"=="" goto alias_exists

goto add_alias

:usage
echo USAGE: ad ^<alias^>
exit /b 1

:alias_exists
echo Alias already exists!
exit /b 1

:add_alias
echo.doskey %1=cd %cd% >>"C:\Ben\aliases.bat"
call "C:\Ben\aliases.bat"
echo Alias was added successfully!
exit /b 0
```

4. **Replace the paths in lines 23 and 24 with the absolute path to your `aliases.bat`.**

5. **Make sure your `aliases.bat` file ends in a trailing newline.** You'll only need to do this once, unless you manually add stuff to your `aliases.bat` later, but this tripped me up for an embarassingly long time.

6. **Open a new session of Command Prompt and alias a directory.**

```console
C:\> cd  Ben\Advent_Of_Code_2019
C:\Ben\Advent_Of_Code_2019> ad  advent
Alias was added successfully!
C:\Ben\Advent_Of_Code_2019> cd  ../..
C:\> advent
C:\Ben\Advent_Of_Code_2019>
```

I'm still very new to batch scripting, so if you find a problem with this script or a way to improve it, [please reach out](https://www.twitter.com/BenDMyers).

## Conclusion

Tweaking my terminal makes programming a more delightful experience for me, and it can for you, too. By aliasing `cd` commands to your most frequently used directories, you cut down on having to juggle potentially long absolute or relative paths. Using the terminal becomes faster, more intuitive, and personal. What's not to love?
