## Introduction

I first learned React and Redux during an internship. I and a team of four other interns contributed to an internal application. As the internship wound down, my team was asked to document the application and what we had learned about the tech stack. After all, we were told, the technologies were pretty new to the company, and our coworkers could benefit from what we had learned.

I took to the task with gusto. I found writing documentation cathartic, and a great way to sort through what I knew while filling in gaps. I gained a reputation as a champion for documentationâ€”one that followed me into my full-time job, and which has been a factor in placing me on projects. Since then, few moments have made me prouder than when a coworker reaches out and thanks me for writing some wiki pages I have long since forgotten about.

Docs have the potential to be an invaluable resource for anyone learning a codebase, process, or technology. More often than not, though, documentation has a reputation for being tedious, confusing, outdated, and unhelpful.

What separates unhelpful docs from docs you can't live without? It's their ability to convey context effectively. This requires being mindful of your audience's needs, providing the clearest path to desired information, and planning for context to change.

## Anticipate Your Audience



These docs were clearly not written for a junior developer with only front-end experience mucking around in batch servers for the first time.

Who do you expect to read your docs? What problems are they trying to solve?

No matter who your target audience isâ€”business, experienced developers, beginners, your future selfâ€”there is one guarantee. They have less context than you do now.

## Make the Documentation Discoverable

## Provide the Clearest Path to Desired Information

## Plan for Entropy

As the clichÃ© goes, the only constant is change. Codebases change, processes change, and technologies change. It's really, really easy for docs to fall out of date. By contrast, maintaining documentation can be difficult and time-consuming. It honestly might not be worth it sometimes.

However, developers are quick to point out that the only thing worse than no documentation is inaccurate documentation. Faced with your documentation's inevitable entropy into obsolescence, you have two options:

1. Prioritize keeping the documentation up-to-date by embedding it into your process.
2. Accept that this documentation will become outdated, but try not to mislead future developers when it does.

Some documentation is too valuable to become outdated. 

This might include business requirements or implementation details.
