## Introduction

I admit it. I'm a sucker for creating little shortcuts and scripts to speed up work in my terminal. There's just something oddly thrilling about typing a few characters and kicking off several commands. I recently read Chiamaka Ikeanyi's [Avoiding Shell Hell: Aliases to the Rescue](https://chiamakaikeanyi.dev/avoiding-shell-hell-aliases-to-the-rescue/), and I was inspired to share some alias tricks I use on a daily basis.

My team at work manages six projects. Each project has its own repository. Additionally, we have repositories for developer tools made by the team. Combine that with any other directories we use on a daily basis, and `cd` quickly becomes our most frequent command.

My favorite terminal trick, for both my home and work computers, is creating short, memorable aliases to `cd` to my most frequent directories. If I want to write a new post, I just type `blog` and I'm in my Gatsby codebase. If I need to tweak the response from a mock server, I type `mock`, and I can start poking around my Express.js code. I rarely have to worry about long, complex relative paths.

## üêß The Unix Way

Pick a directory you use often, and a memorable alias you'll use to hop to that directory instantly. In my case, I want to go to my `~/blog` directory whenever I use my `blog` alias.

Open your terminal and type:

```shell {promptLines: 1-3}
alias blog="cd ~/blog"
cd some/other/directory/
blog
```

Let's test this out now. 

## ü¶á The Windows Way
