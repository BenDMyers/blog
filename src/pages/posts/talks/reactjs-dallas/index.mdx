Last night, I had the opportunity to present at the monthly [ReactJS Dallas meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ReactJSDallas/). It was my first time presenting to the developer community at large, and I'm so glad I did it! Thank you to everyone who came out, and to Call-Em-All for hosting!

During this talk, I went on a journey through American case law to answer two big questions:

1. Does the law require websites to be accessible?

2. If so, which standards of web accessibility are we held to?

This talk was largely inspired by [my first blogpost](https://blog.benmyers.dev/dominos-1/), except it includes details about the Supreme Court's decision on <i>Robles v. Domino's</i>.
